We are going to implement a function that determines the winner of a round of Shipit. Our function is going to look something like this:


/**
 * Process a list of ballots, and return all candidates sorted in descending order by their total number of points.
 */ 
List<String> getResults(List<Ballot> ballots)


We pass in a list of ballots and we are returned a list of names in the descending order of the score that each candidate received.
Assume that we extract the candidates' names from the ballots as we process them.
A voter is allowed to vote for up to three different candidates. The order of the votes is important. The first vote that a voter places is worth three points. The second vote is worth two points. The third vote is worth one point.
The function should return a list of candidates in descending order of the total number of points received by the candidate.
